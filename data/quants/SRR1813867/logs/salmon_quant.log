[2017-11-22 17:49:03.330] [jointLog] [info] Computed 241122 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-11-22 17:49:03.330] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3923213 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-11-22 17:49:03.352] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3923213 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
