[2017-11-22 16:12:43.461] [jointLog] [info] Computed 284942 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-11-22 16:12:43.461] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4906564 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-11-22 16:12:43.488] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4906564 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
