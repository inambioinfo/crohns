[2017-11-22 17:19:59.515] [jointLog] [info] Computed 287241 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-11-22 17:19:59.515] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3823069 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-11-22 17:19:59.542] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3823069 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
