## Setup for this tutorial

1. Make sure you have an up-to-date version of [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/). 
   The tutorial should work with R >= 3.3, but it's always a good idea
   to stay up-to-date with R and Bioconductor, as bugs are fixed and
   code is made more efficient.
2. If you haven't already,
   [install Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/install). The basic
   installation can be completed with:

```{r}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite()
```

3. Install the following packages (if you have some already installed
   you can skip these):

```{r}
pkgs <- c("here","readr","GenomicFeatures","tximport","DESeq2","org.Hs.eg.db","goseq")
find.package(pkgs) # this will give an ERROR if any not found
biocLite(pkgs)
```

If you have any questions about setting up for the tutorial you can
email me at `michaelisaiahlove` at `gmail.com`.
